# Finite Element Program for Thermo-mechanical Truss structure

The project focuses on creating a Finite Element Program from scratch for Thermo-mechanical Truss structures. 

## Aim of the project
The main aim of the project is to create a Program which solves and visualized a Thermo-mechanical coupling problems in the truss structers.
The scenario implemented in the program is 3-Dimensional, however even 1-D and/ or 2-D truss problems can be solved and visualized using the program.

This project files can be explained as below:- 

### \src\fem_ThermoMech
The above folder comprises of the java classes implemented to create the program. Object-oriented programming concepts were used to make all the files kind-off talk to each other.

### \src\model_ThermoMech
The above folder comprises of the java main filesto create various benchmark problems to validate the program. A Benchmark problem was used to validate the program and then the program was further extended to two problems, viz. Small tetrahedral truss structure and finally a full fledged structurral bridge.
